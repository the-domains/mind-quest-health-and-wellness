Hi... My name is Jim Andre... I am a successful spiritual healer. We all know how devastating terminal illnesses can be, not to mention the overwhelming expense regarding a possible cure through the medical and pharmaceutical industries.  Anyone     diagnosed with cancer, for example, is not only devastated by the mind-numbing news, but also uncertain as to how they are going to be able to afford the (also devastating) chemo and/or radiation they will endure while being treated. Ironically, both chemo therapy & radiation treatments contain cancer causing carcinogens, which, in most cases, causes the patient to become unbearably ill during treatment, and the cure success rate is much lower than the 

medical and pharmaceutical industries would like you to believe. How do they get away with administering cancer causing treatments and charge outrageous costs that will undoubtedly lead many down the road to bankruptcy? It is an industry. It is all about the almighty buck, not the well-being of the patient.

But there are  much more effective (and less lethal) alternative cures that the government & 

the medical and pharmaceutical industries frown upon and don't want you to know about or have concern with...
